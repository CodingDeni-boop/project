TO DO: 

FEATURE SELECTION:
  1. TRAIN, TEST, REMOVE 1 FEATURE
  2. REPEAT UNTIL HIGH LOSS OF MODEL POTENTIAL. 
  3. HEATMAP SHOULD HELP.

CRAZY IDEA: 
  1. CLUSTER 6000 FEATURES THROUGH UNSUPERVISED ML
  2. THROW SUPERVISED MODEL ON THE VARIABLES THAT ARE NOW CLUSTERS
  3. VALIDATE ON DIFFERENT CLUSTERS
