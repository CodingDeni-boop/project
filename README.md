TO DO: 

DATA SPLITTING:
  1. TAKE 10% - 15% FOR TEST
  2. CROSS VALIDATE ON THE REMAINING
       - PARAMETER TUNING = 70% - 80%
       - HYPERPARAMETER TUNING (VALIDATION) = 10% - 15%

FEATURE SELECTION:
TRAIN, TEST, REMOVE 1 FEATURE, REPEAT UNTIL HIGH LOSS OF MODEL POTENTIAL. HEATMAP SHOULD HELP.
