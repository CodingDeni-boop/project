TO DO: 

DATA SPLITTING:
  1. TAKE 10% - 15% FOR TEST
  2. CROSS VALIDATE ON THE REMAINING
       - PARAMETER TUNING = 70% - 80%
       - HYPERPARAMETER TUNING (VALIDATION) = 10% - 15%

FEATURE SELECTION:
  TRAIN, TEST, REMOVE 1 FEATURE, REPEAT UNTIL HIGH LOSS OF MODEL POTENTIAL. 
  HEATMAP SHOULD HELP.

CRAZY IDEA: 
  1. CLUSTER 6000 FEATURES THROUGH UNSUPERVISED ML
  2. THROW SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL ON THE VARIABLES THAT ARE NOW CLUSTERS
  3. VALIDATE ON DIFFERENT CLUSTERS
